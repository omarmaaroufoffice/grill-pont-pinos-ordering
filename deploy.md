# 🚀 Automatic Deployment Instructions

## What I've Set Up For You:

✅ **render.yaml** - Automatic Render configuration
✅ **Enhanced server** - Better error handling and logging
✅ **Robust build process** - Ensures React app builds properly
✅ **Environment detection** - Automatically works in production

## Your Deployment is Now Automated!

### Option 1: Render Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
Since you have `render.yaml` in your repo, Render should automatically:
1. Detect the configuration
2. Build your app correctly
3. Set the right environment variables
4. Deploy successfully

### Option 2: Manual Render Setup (If needed)
If auto-deploy doesn't work, use these exact settings:

**Build Command:**
```
npm install && cd client && npm install && npm run build
```

**Start Command:**
```
npm start
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
NODE_ENV = production
RENDER = true
```

## 🎯 Your Live URLs:
- **Customer Menu**: https://grill-pont-pinos-ordering.onrender.com
- **Admin Dashboard**: https://grill-pont-pinos-ordering.onrender.com/admin

## 📱 QR Code Ready!
Once deployed, your QR code will point to:
`https://grill-pont-pinos-ordering.onrender.com`

## 🔍 Debugging:
The server now has detailed logging that will show:
- Environment variables
- Build directory status
- File existence checks
- Exact error locations

If there are still issues, check the Render logs for these debug messages.
